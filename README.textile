h1. SPL Compiler

This project is a compiler for a small imperative language named _SPL_ (Simple Programming Language). The compiler is written in Haskell and is fully working. It only makes use of the basic Haskell modules and contains as little hacks as possible.

Compiler features:
* Built-in parser
* Type checking (and basic inference)
* Intel x86 backend

h2. Language features

* C-style imperative language
* Support for *lists* and *tuples*
* Full support for *generic types*

Example SPL:


bc.. [int] reverse ([int] list)
{
	[int] accu = [];
	while(!empty(list))
	{
		accu = head(list) : accu;
		list = tail(list);
	}
	return accu;
}


h2. Compilation

First, compile the compiler:

@ghc -o splc --make Main.hs@

Then, generate the Intel assembly of a .spl file with:

@./splc hello_world.spl@

Save the assembly code from the output to a .asm file. Finally, create the executable:

bc.. nasm -f elf hello_world.asm
gcc -m32 -o hello_world hello_world.o
